Thank you for supporting our work!

DECEMBER 2024 UPDATE
My packs contain shared scripts, shaders, and other content, which is kept up to date in the "Support Files" package (free) on the Asset Store:

https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/infinity-pbr-support-files-160921?aid=1100lxWw

When I updated the shared files, I will keep the "Support Files" package up to date. The updates are not required for character packs, which will be updated:

1. When updates to the Shared Files are required for the character packs
2. From time to time to keep them in sync.

If you install an older package, Unity will overwrite the existing (newer) versions of the Shared Files if you don't uncheck the files in the Import window. Any errors or issues after import are likely due to this. To fix, please install the Support Files package.

BUNDLE PACKS
These packs have no real content in them, but rather provide the ability to purchase the individual packs for free. Each bundle will list and link to individual packs and bonus packs in the description on the bundle page on the Asset Store.

PACKS WITH BONUS CONTENT
Many, or most, of our work comes with "Bonus" content. This is things like source files, sometimes additional textures, and more. Once you have the entitlement for the main package, you can "buy" the bonus packs for free. 

Each package will list all bonus packs included in the description on the Asset Store.
